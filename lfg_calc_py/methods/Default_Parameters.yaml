# Common parameters used throughout methods

## Model Parameters
degradable_organic_carbon: 0.17 # Fractional amount of degradable organic carbon in the year of
# deposition, Mg C / Mg waste
degradable_organic_carbon_fraction: 0.5 # Fraction of the degradable organic carbon that can be
# decomposed
methane_content: 0.50 # Fraction by volume of methane in the landfill gas
methane_correction_factor: 1 # Methane correction factor (fraction) for aerobic decomposition in the
# year of deposition
landfill_lifespan: 100 # Default lifespan of landfill from open to close
methane_oxidation: True # Whether methane undergoes oxidation
methane_oxidation_fraction: 0.1 # Fractional amount of generated methane that is oxidized
