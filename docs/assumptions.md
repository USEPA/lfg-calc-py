# Assumptions

- If landfill_open is not specified, the calculation assumes that waste is being deposited in the first year of the landfill’s operation
- If landfill gas is collected, the collection system is assumed to be installed in the same year as the waste is first disposed of in the landfill (thus “Year 0” for LFG collection equals “Year 0” for waste acceptance)
- The "final cover" efficiency is assumed to be the same as "Year 15+" efficiency in landfill gas collection scenarios
- Landfill gas collection system technology is assumed to be identical regardless of year; note that collection systems did not exist prior to the mid-1990s
